# CubistHackathon2023
This 1st-place project at Cubist Systemic Strategies' inaugural hackathon was a joint effort between 4 students at Columbia, Cornell, and Yale. By analyzing publicly available motor vehicle collision and facility location data, the group identified areas of greatest need for ambulance stations in each of New York City's 5 boroughs.
