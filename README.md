# CubistHackathon2023 - Overview
This 1st-place project at Cubist Systemic Strategies' inaugural hackathon was a joint effort between 4 students at Columbia University, Cornell University, and Yale University. By analyzing publicly available motor vehicle collision and facility location data, the group identified areas of greatest need for ambulance stations in each of New York City's 5 boroughs.

## Hackathon Background
Cubist Systematic Strategies, the systematic investing business of Point72, hosted its first ever hackathon in April 2023, inviting roughly 50 students from top universities in the Northeast. The participants broke off into roughly 15 self-selected teams to explore publicly available New York City data and present meaningful, actionable insights. My team consisted of myself (an Applied Analytics Master's student at Columbia University), an Operations Research PhD student at Columbia University, and two Computer Science sophomores, one from Cornell University and the other from Yale University. 

## Problem
Roughly 65% of the ambulances in New York City are operated by the fire department (FDNY), and these ambulances face growing inefficiencies that threaten ambulance response time and, by extension, patient outcomes. Between July 2021 and October 2022, ambulances experienced a **35** second increase in time to travel to the scene. Furthermore, from July to October of 2022, ambulance response times (getting to the scene and getting the patient to the nearest hospital) averaged **7 minutes and 55 seconds**, a *full minute longer* than the set target.

These inefficiencies were largely attributed to a) a 10% increase (20,000) in life-threatening medical emergencies in the last year, b) worsening traffic, and c) insufficient staffing and equipment. As such, our group sought to determine locations of ambulance stations in each New York City borough (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island) that would best minimize ambulance response time (our "cost") while identifying which current station is in the greatest need of added support.

## Target Audience and Call to Action
Our project was created with the intention of convincing New York City Mayor Eric Adams' Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to increase FDNY funding to support the following actions:
1. Construction of new EMS service centers for each of the 5 boroughs
   - Manhattan - 43rd Street & Broadway (Times Square)
   - Brooklyn - 64th Street & 21st Avenue (Mapleton)
   - The Bronx - Aldus Street & Bryant Avenue (Longwood)
   - Queens - 102nd Street & 103rd Avenue (Ozone Park)
   - Staten Island - Genesee Avenue & Stanley Circle (Eltingville)

2. Increased staffing and ambulances at the Pier 35 and 36 EMS station in Manhattan's Lower East Side
